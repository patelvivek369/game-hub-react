# GameHub

GameHub is a video game discovery web app that helps you find new and interesting games to play. With GameHub, you can search for games by platform, genre, and more.

This is the project I build with react and chakra UI

## About the Project

The goal of this project was to create an application that allows users to search for games based on their genres or platforms they want to play them:

- Build front-end apps with React and TypeScript
- Build reusable function components
- Style your components using vanilla CSS, CSS modules, and CSS-in-JS and Chakra UI
- Manage component state
- Build forms with React Hook Forms
- Implement form validation using Zod
- Connect your React apps to the backend
